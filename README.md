3D-Game-of-Life
===============

A 3D implementation of John Conway's Game of Life, extended with puzzle elements, alternate perspectives, and other features.

This repository was created as a copy of https://github.com/jnthnhinson/3D-Game-of-Life for the purposes of adding a gh-pages branch for my page. The original is at the above link, and the contributors are also listed. I did not make this on my own, but with the help of my peers, and this is a blatant copy. If you like what you see, be sure to credit the original repo.
